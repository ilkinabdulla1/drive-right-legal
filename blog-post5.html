      <p class="lead">
        Electric vehicles rely heavily on battery systems, making battery
        performance and reliability a central legal issue for EV owners.
        While manufacturers typically offer extended warranties for batteries,
        many drivers misunderstand the scope and limits of these protections.
      </p>

      <h3>1. What EV Battery Warranties Usually Cover</h3>
      <p>
        Most EV manufacturers provide separate battery warranties that last
        longer than standard vehicle warranties. These warranties commonly
        cover defects in materials, workmanship, and severe battery capacity
        degradation.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, normal wear and gradual capacity loss are often excluded
        unless the degradation falls below a specific threshold.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Warranty Limitations and Exclusions</h3>
      <p>
        Battery warranties may exclude damage caused by improper charging,
        unauthorized repairs, accidents, or environmental factors such as
        flooding or extreme temperatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding these exclusions is critical, as disputes often arise
        when manufacturers argue that battery failure resulted from user
        behavior rather than a defect.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Recalls and Manufacturer Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        Battery-related recalls have become more common as EV adoption grows.
        In cases involving fire risks or safety defects, manufacturers are
        legally required to repair, replace, or buy back affected vehicles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Failure to act promptly may expose manufacturers to regulatory
        penalties and consumer lawsuits.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Real Case Example</h3>
      <p>
        In a realistic dispute, an EV owner experienced rapid battery
        degradation well before the warranty expiration date. The manufacturer
        initially refused replacement, claiming normal degradation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Independent diagnostic reports showed abnormal capacity loss beyond
        warranty limits. As a result, the manufacturer replaced the battery
        under warranty.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Legal Options for EV Owners</h3>
      <p>
        EV owners have the right to challenge warranty denials through written
        complaints, regulatory authorities, or courts. Consumer protection
        laws often apply alongside warranty law.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keeping charging records, service history, and diagnostic reports
        strengthens a driver’s legal position in battery-related disputes.
      </p>

      <p>
        As electric vehicles become more common, understanding battery
        warranties and legal risks will be essential for informed ownership.
