      <div class="why-card">
        <h4>Lack of Legal Awareness</h4>
        <p>
          Many drivers are unaware of their rights after accidents or
          during disputes with insurers and mechanics.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h4>Power Imbalance</h4>
        <p>
          Insurance companies, repair shops, and dealers often have more
          legal knowledge than individual drivers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-card">
        <h4>Complex Legal Language</h4>
        <p>
          Laws are written for professionals, not everyday car owners.
          This platform translates legal rules into plain language.
